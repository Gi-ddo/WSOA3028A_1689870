# Character portfolio  website

This repo contains my very first website that I made for my Web Development course.
I had to create a website for fictional character based in Joburg.

I used HTML,CSS and Java Script for this site with more emphasis on Java Script in creating
a mini-game for my character to enchance their story.

I was overall happy with my experience as it was my first attempt and I learned alot of this project.

Please feel free to explore the website on the link below:
