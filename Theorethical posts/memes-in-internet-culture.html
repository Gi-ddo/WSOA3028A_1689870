     <h1>Memes and Their influence on internet culture</h1>
<P>
  Memes have been a rapidly growing influence in how entertainment is generated in our modern times and it has had a huge influence in modern internet culture as well.
  memes are often described as genes, they rapidly grow and spread. As they spread they start to create different trends and behaviours that we see on the internet and 
  through social media. These major trends often result in something going viral , from expressions famous people use , music, movies and every single digital media 
  that you can think of.
