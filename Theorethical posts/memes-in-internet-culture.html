     <h1>Memes and Their influence on internet culture</h1>
<P>
  Memes have been a rapidly growing influence in how entertainment is generated in our modern times and it has had a huge influence on modern internet culture as well.
  memes are often described as genes, they rapidly grow and spread. As they spread they start to create different trends and behaviors that we see on the internet and through social media. These major trends often result in something going viral, from expressions famous people use, music, movies, and every single digital media that you can think of.
