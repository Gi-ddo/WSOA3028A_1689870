        <h1>Data implications of online learning</h1>
      <p>
        The issue of the availability of data to students has always been at the forefront of the argument against online learning. This issue is very real especially in South Africa due to the massive economic divide between students from different backgrounds. Due to the nature of online learning where students have to be online to attend live calls or video streams on streaming platforms is a huge strain on data usage. Students that have access to unlimited/
        uncapped internet access will be far more advantageous than students with limited internet access and those with none at all.
    </p>  

    <p>
        The way to combat this pressing matter is for our respective institutions to come together and formulate a plan to get every student access to online material. There are several ways to do this, institutions can make arrangements with service providers to allocate a sufficient amount of data to students so that they can have access to online material. This data will be accompanied by compressed recorded sessions that can be downloaded by students at very low data costs, this way every student is not left behind.
        The second alternative is to making arrangements with service providers to make all learning sites including academic streaming platforms(MS teams/ Zoom)
        zero-rated for easy access for students.
