    <h1>Data implications of online learning</h1>

    <article>
      <p>
        The issue of the availability of data to students has always been on the forefront of the argument against online 
        learning. This issues is very real especially in South Africa due to the massive economic divide between students
        from different backgrounds. Due to the nature of online learning where students have to be online to attend live 
        calls or video streams on streaming platforms is a huge strain on data usage. Students that have access to unlimited/
        uncapped internet access will be far more advantageous than students with limited internet access and those with none at
        all. 
    </p>  

    <p>
        The way to combat this pressing matter is for our respective institutions to come together and formulate a plan to get very 
        student access to online material. There are serveral ways to do this, institutions can make arrangements with service providers
        to allocate a sufficent amount of data to students to that they can have access to online material. This data will be accompanied 
        by compressed recorded sessions that can be downloaded by students at very low data costs, this way every student is not left behind.
        The second alternative is to making arrangements with service providers to make all learning sites including academic streaming platforms(MS teams/ Zoom)
        zero rated for easy access for students.
