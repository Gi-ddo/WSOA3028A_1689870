            <h1>External dependacy</h1>

            <p>
               For the purposes of exam submission I had to incoorperate an external dependacy that reflects and challenges the physical and digital world.
               for my site I chose to link my dependacy with my character. There is a moment in Sip's journey where they come across an arcade, they explore it
               and Sip's has a blast while playing space invaders. Sip's normally documents his discoveries through pictures or souvenirs so he was not able to document
               the arcade machine the way he wanted so he decided to implement a similar version of space invaders to take back home. With that in mind I thought that it 
               would be really cool and interactive to implement such a system to give my character more dept, to create a classic game for users to have fun with  and to
               engage in an old school arcade game in the modern digital space.    
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                For the project I used the P5.js JavaScript library to accomplish this. I chose the P5 library because it provides pretty good functionality for drawining objects
                and has a variety of functions that express creative coding. The library itself is very user friendly and is very accessible to beginner programmers, which makes the 
                barrier of entry extreamly low. The library also has integrated functionality with HTML which means it will not be hasle to combine my HTML code with the JavaScript 
                code which I will be using to implement the game. There are a few other libraries that can achieve the same result, one of the most poplular Javascript libraries JQuery can perform the same task with a varying difficulty level. The main reason why I chose P5 over JQuery was for the mere reason  of the graphical functionality that P5 presents, which makes things like making the level, enemies and player with relative ease compared to JQuery which heavily focuses on solving cross data issues and improving web development.
            </p>

            <p>
                The usage of p5 has been made very easy to understand, the only thing you have to do is to download the JavaScript file from the P5 website and store it somewhere safe on your site. The file contains all of the necessary functions and functionality required to start working on p5, users can also download the full package which contains addons for sound and other interactive features that the library has to offer. The library also  provides users with a handful HTML and JavaScript example to get you started. What sets P5 apart from other libraries is that it provides the user with a canvas to use as a template for their application. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall making Space invaders is a heavily  JavaScript project, and most of its functionality full under basic JavaScript and most of the functionality p5 provides to create the enemies, the  bullets and the player himself.
                P5 was a wonderful library that allowed me to create and interactive feature for my website from the eyes of my character and taking on the task of replicating an old classic game.
