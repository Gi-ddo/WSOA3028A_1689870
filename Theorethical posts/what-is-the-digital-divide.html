                    The digital divide has been a topic of discussion since the rise of the technological era and the topic can be applied to a variety of issues that pertain to technology. So to give a generic definition of the term, <q>The digital divide is the gap that exists between individuals  who access
                        to modern information and communication technology to those that lack it.</q> This definition can be narrowed down to a few factors that involve the digital divide these include:

                    <h2>Social Divide:</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p> 
                        With the introduction of the internet, social gatherings have evolved from traditional meet and greet in common areas to dedicated groups and circles on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This form of social interaction has created a new dynamic of how people share information stories or entertainment, I mean look at how people are sharing jokes through memes, take a look at how Twitter has been a media for drama and platform to share stories and raise awareness about certain issues.
                        The internet has drastically changed how social interactions work, now people who are sidelined  by the lack of internet access due to where they
                        live, family background is automatically divided by this social circle that it practically becomes impossible to have a conversation with some people.
                        Imagine having a gathering with these two kinds of people, the way they would present themselves to how they talk and act becomes inherently different
                        and not in a good because the divide is so huge that the people with access these technologies would not treat the other people as equals and see them as 
                        inferior and this does not pose a good image I feel.

                    <h2>Educational Divide:</h2>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        This section has more effect in our country than in the previous section, and it hits closer to home. Our educational system in this country is every changing but not fast enough. With the rapid growth of technology and the decline of traditional teaching methods, it is almost becoming essential for a learner to have access to any form of technology to be able to learn and survive in this technology is driven world. This issue mentioned comes now to the issue of the educational divide and how it can be drastically impactful at different stages of the educational phase. Typically at the university level of education, the use of technology is heavily emphasized from being able to operate a computer to write out your assignments, having internet access to access resources for studying to being able to code, and operate other functionality of the computer. The divide here comes in when certain students have had access to these technologies before other students or have internet access at home, the results start showing in performance where said students start performing better and the other students have to play catch-up, this I feel is a very important topic to mention especially in South Africa as it is very prevalent.

                        This issue does not only apply to students and learners alike, but teachers are also suffering from this issue. As technology in learning is becoming integrated into the system it is becoming harder to find experienced teachers with sufficient technical skills to take advantage of the new technology implementations into the educational system. This also extends to how technological devices are used in schools as well, typically computers are used to view information to students this is usually done in poor schools that do not have experienced teachers to teach learners on the technologies themselves and how to improve their skills in learning.
                        In the best schools, learners are taught various aspects of the computer, how to program, how to make documents, and how to prepare presentations alike using the tools at their
                        disposal, this prepares these students for the expectations of university and also gives more detail on how the educational divide extends is an extension of the digital divide.
