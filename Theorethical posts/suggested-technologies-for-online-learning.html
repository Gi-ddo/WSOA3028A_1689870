            Possible techologies for online learning
          </h1>
        <p>
            The process of moving from contact learning to online learning is big for us as a country and an opportunity to explore different avenues for education. In a time like this, the approach to online learning is rather different than if we were to look at it as a different form of education while using the current form we have now. The idea is to keep learning as engaging as possible and make it accessible to everyone as we all deserve the same level of education. Podcasts can be pursued as a possible technology to implement, podcasts are very engaging, it feels as though people are having a casual conversation while discussing important topics they are also very engaging because everyone that is participating in the podcast is speaking and providing input and it doesn't feel like we're listening to a lecturer rambling about a topic. Even if the podcast is prerecorded they are often much more accessible because as students in our modern times it is much easy for us to do some related to our phones than reading 15-20 page reading that we might not even finish, it almost feels like we're listening to music and it is easier to grasp information and I feel like this is a great way to keep students engaged with the work.

            Another technology that I think would be a great inclusion in the online learning space, this is in regards to the technical side
         of the course(the coding), is the use of online mini-games that teach students how to program in a very interactive way. Since we're game designer
         and we enjoy playing games, introducing games into the educational space especially online is a great way of keeping students motivated 
         and teaches them new concepts of the technical work which makes it easier to develop their websites faster but also the amount of research most of us spend
        online trying to figure out how to do something in javascript or CSS.
