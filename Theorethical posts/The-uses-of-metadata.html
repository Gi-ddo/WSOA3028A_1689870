        <h1>The uses of metadata</h1>

        <p>
            Metadata is defined as the data that describes data. what does that mean? It essentially means that we are
            given more information to describe the data we are presenting in our documents.
            In the web, development metadata is extremely important because it gives life and more meaning to our websites. Examples of metadata include the title of our website, our websites would not any value if they did not a title.
            Search engines would not be able to find our websites and we do not want this. Another example is the website
            descriptions, website descriptions give an overview of what to expect when someone decides to click on your
            website.
            This why most web developers try their best to make their website descriptions as appealing as possible.
        </p>

        <p>A trivial example would be from social media websites as soon as we search for Facebook or
            Instagram we get these very compelling descriptions telling us to sign up and we can share and post all
            sorts of things that we can share with friends and family.
            Without meta descriptions, most websites would not be visited because people do not want to waste their time
            looking at sites that do not draw them into clicking on it.
            This use of metadata also links very well with accessibility, to give context the charset metadata module makes the websites render every single Character set known to man. This means that you can make your site accessible to everyone from every country because your website can translate into their language.
            This use of metadata is really powerful and should be inforced more into web development.
