            <h1>Link between changing technology and development and spread of internet culture</h1>
                    <h2>Social Media</h2>
                    <p>
                        The relationship between social media and technology has been closely related throughout time and how both mediums interact has improved and brought forward new ways of communication and entertainment. Social media before the dawn of the internet as we know it today was not a thing. The closest form of social media pre-internet would be magazines and newspapers where people connect through long distances and have interactions with other people.

                    <p>Trying to
                        define social media before the internet is a very difficult task and stems as a good starting point for the development of the term. Through the development of the technology over the years, the concept of social media would transform drastically into what we have today where communication and the spread of information are at the click of a button and people connect online rather than through magazines and newspapers. The concept of internet culture would be born where digital mediums like <em>Facebook</em> , <em>Instagram</em> , <em>Twitter</em> , <em>Vine</em>
                        exist that serve different purposes for different people.
                   </p>
   
                     <p>  Instagram serves the purpose of the people showing off their lives and communicating through images and creating fanbases through that. Twitter serves the purpose of widespread information about various topics of the world from entertainment like memes, news, sports, and even celebrity wars through twitter and its cesspool of information. Vine serving the purpose of providing people with entertainment through acted out memes. These form different internet cultures that serve different people in different ways through the internet and it is growing every day.
