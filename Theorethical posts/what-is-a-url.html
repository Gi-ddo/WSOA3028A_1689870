              <h1>What is a URL?</h1>

             <p>
             A uniform resource loader (URL) is a unique identifier to find resources on the internet. It is often called the web address of a website and it consists of different properties mainly called the protocol and the domain name. These main function is telling the browsers where and how to retrieve information or a resource of the WWW.

             <h2>URL structure</h2>
             <br>

             <p>As mentioned above the URL contains the protocol and the domain name. The protocol is what is needed  to access information or a resource
                URL protocols include HTTP and HTTPS  for mainly web resources and mail addresses. For file transfer, the FTP protocol is responsible for that functionality. The second part of the URL is responsible for identifying domain names and IP addresses. This tells us where the resource is loaded. The URL also specifies a few key bits of information including:
