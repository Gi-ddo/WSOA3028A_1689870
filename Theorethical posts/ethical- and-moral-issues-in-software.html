            Date:29 May 2020

            <br>

            So this tweet was sent to me by my lecturer and it caught my interest because it raises a lot of issues in the software industry and other important issues that I will be talking about in this post. The tweet will be shown below:
        </p>

        <img src="../Pictures/@Grady_Booch - Every line of software has an ethical and moral im.png" alt="Picture of a tweet" width="30%" height="30%">

        <br>

        <p>
            In the tweet above the user, @Grady_Booch is commenting on a twitter post outlining that there are ethical and moral Implications in software. This piqued my interest based on the context of what he is referring to. The tweet he is commenting on is a tweet from a doctor named Dr. Shajul Islam more on him <a href="https://twitter.com/DrShajulIslam">here</a>
            who is a Humanitarian aid worker, who is currently working in Syria, saving lives as Syria is a very dangerous place for doctors to be in. In the tweet, he goes on to ask for help on how to the user a specific ventilator mentioned on the tweet. Now while this tweet a few interesting ideas and points came into mind that I feel like I should discuss in this blog which should highlight the point @Grady_Booch was trying to make and comment on some of the things I felt towards this twitter post. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            So in my search for some clarity for answers and I did some research starting at the core of the problem which was the ventilator the doctor mentioned on the tweet. According to the  official website of the 
            <q>Puritan Bennett PB840 Ventilator</q>, the machine is capable of doing wonderful things in terms of medical care and is a technological powerhouse based on what is being said on the website. Now you will notice that I did not mention specifics on what specifically it can do and how it does it, well this is because I understood very little of what is being said about this machine,  yes I am not a medical expert of a qualified engineer to understand these terms which brings me to the point of this discussion, what is the point of making such a machine if very little people will understand what you are presenting to them.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            There is very little information that is comprehensive enough for the general user to understand what is happening in this machine, you either need to go out of your way to find a well-documeneted tutorial teaching you how to use this machine or forums on people trying to understand the machine as well. This posses a very important discussion in software development with regards to accessibility in design, as a developer, it is your job to make products that are accessible to as many users as possible, and this brings in ethical and moral issues into place Here as @Grady_Booch mentions in the tweet, this machine is meant for medical use, a machine to save lives yet the people who are supposed to be using these devices are not able to operate it as Dc Shajul mentions as he asks for help in the tweet. People could die, get seriously injured if the proper health care is not administered in time and as a software developer you would have failed in your job. In the tweet Dr. Shajul mentions that he is in Syria, Syria is not the most technologically advanced country to their constant fight against terrorism it is hard to find the time to learn about a lot of things and Dr. Shajul mentions that it is too difficult for them to understand, they cannot even get the safety lock-off. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            I felt that this was a very good thing to talk about because it also links with our course and how we tackle web development and how we are taught to make accessible websites for people to use and enjoy. We could easily get too involved in the technical aspects of a website and forget how to make it useable for the general public, for example, a developer can make a banking website where people can easily get lost in the system where they can easily lose their money because they do not know what they doing. After all, the website is so complicated to access and this can scale into more advanced sites that can put people's lives in danger. In conclusion, this tweet is an example of how incompetence can result in disastrous outcomes particularly when lives are at stake and what you as a reader can take away from this is how accessible can make the most complicated piece of software or hardware can be easily used by anyone if done right.
