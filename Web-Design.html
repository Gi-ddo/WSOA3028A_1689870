        <h3>WireFrame discussion</h3>
        <P>The use of layers as shown in the wireframe, is the emphasis the theme of mystery in my Characters journal and my character in general, as you got through the website each layer starts opening and new information is revealed to the reader.
            At the moment I am thinking about changing about changing the order of the layers from welcome section being the first layer, blogs being the second layer and museum being the final layer, more layers could be added  time will tell.
            I thik the change will make more sense for the theme that I am using for the site.
        </P>
