            <h1>Link between changing technology and development and spread of internet culture</h1>
                    <h3>Social Media</h3>
                    <p>
                       The relationship between social media and technology has been closely related throughout time and how both mediums
                       interact has improved and brought forward new ways of communication and entertainment. Social media before the dawn of
                       the internet as we know it today was not really a thing. The closest form of social media pre internet would be
                       magazines and newspapers where people connect through long distances and have interactions with other people.

                    <p>Trying to
                       define social media before the internet is a very difficult task and stems as a good starting point for development of
                       the term. Through the development of the technology over the years, the concept of social media would transform
                       drastically into what we have today where communication and the spread of information is at the click of a button and
                       people connect online rather than through magazines and newspapers. The concept of internet culture would be born where digital mediums like <em>Facebook</em> , <em>Instagram</em> , <em>Twitter</em> , <em>Vine</em>
                       exist that serve different purposes for different people.

                     <p>Instagram serves the purpose of the people showing off their
                       lives and communicating through images and creating fanbases through that. Twitter serves the purpose of widespread
                       information about various topics of the world from entertainment like memes, news, sports and even celebrity wars
                       through twitter and its cesspool of information. Vine serving the purpose of providing people with entertainment through
                       acted out memes. These form different internet culture that serve different people in different ways through the
                       internet and it is growing every day.
