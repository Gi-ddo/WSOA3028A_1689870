        <h1>The importance of Accessibility </h1>

        <p>
            Accessibility in web development is the practice of making websites usable by as many people as possible. They can be
            generally viewed as making your website accessible by the disabled, users on mobile devices and people with poor network
            connections.
        </p>

        <p>
            This practice is important because first of all by making your website accessible you will bring more people into your
            website to use it and this is important because if developers were making a service based website therefore many people
            would be able to use it because its user friendly for everyone and benefits the developers as well in them being
            successful in their businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
            The practice is also important because it shows good moral and ethical values. Accessible websites provide equal access
            and equal opportunity to people who are disable or donâ€™t have effective means of using the internet i.e. slow internet
            connections. This makes it easier to do business with disable people and giving them the tools to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
            Making a website accessible is indeed important but how to make it accessible is an important skill to have. The ways
            developers make their websites accessible are as follows:
        </p>

         <ol>
             <li>
                <p>
                    Semantic markup: With the correct use of semantic markup we make our websites accessible for users and it makes our
                    websites easier to find on the web.
                </p>
             </li>

             <li>
                 <p>
                    Extensions: These are key because they provide more options for people. These include software to help with audio
                    impairment, visual impairment tools like zooming features, keyboard functionality for people with physical disability.
                 </p>
             </li>
         </ol>
