      Possible techologies for online learning

        The process of moving from contact learning to online learning is a big for us as a country and an opportunity to explore 
        different avenues for education. In a time like this the approach to online learning is rather different than if we were to look 
        at as a different for of education while using the current form we have now. The idea is to keep learning as engaging as Possible
        and make it accessible to everyone as we all deserve the same level of education. Podcasts can be pursued as a possible technology to
        implement, podcasts are very enaging, it feels as though people are having a casual conversation while discussion important topics
        they are also very engaging because everyone that is participating in the podcast is speaking and  provding input and it doesn't feel like
        we're listening to a lecturer rambling about a topic. Even if the podcast are prerecorded they are often much more accessible  because 
        as students in our modern times it is much easy for us to do some related to our phones than reading 15-20 page reading that we might not
        even finish, it almost feels like we're listening to music and it is easier to grasp information and I feel like this is great way to keep students enagaged with
        the work.

         Another technology that I think would be a great inclusion in the online learning space, this is in regards to the technical side
         of the course(the coding), is the use of online mini games that teach students how to program in a very interactive way. Since we're game designer
         and we really enjoy playing games, introducing games into the educational space especially online is a great way of keeping students motivated 
         and teaches them new concepts of the technical work which makes it easier to develop their websites faster but also the amount of reseach most of us spend
        online trying to figure out how to do someting in java script or CSS.
