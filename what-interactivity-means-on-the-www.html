      <h1>Interactivity on the www</h1>
   <P>
    Interactivity in its basic form means the process of two things working together or influencing each other in an shape or form. In the space of the WWW
    this definition works well in showing how developers make their websites more accessible by just increasing the level of Interactivity between the user 
    and the medium they are using to access the WWW. To bring more light into this point we use browsers to access the WWW, the browser provides ways that 
    promote a significant amount of Interactivity between the users and the WWW. For example if we want to search for the meaning of a word, the browsers provides 
    us with a form of user input where we can search for what we want and it responds in the way that we expect it, by providing us with the information that we 
    want(the meaning of the word).
   </P>

   <p>
    The example above fits in nicely the definition of Interactivity in the space of the WWW. Something is said to be Interactive if it is responsive, does not responds
    in a random fashion and requires nontrivial efforts, all of these fit nicely into the example mentioned above. This theory can even be explore further in the space of the WWW
    by how images, sound and even our mouse input follow the definition really well in the space of the WWW. To conclude what Interactivity means on the WWW, is finding ways to bring
    users and the the WWW together in ways that are easy and responsive which means the process of exploring the web accessible to everyone interacting with it.
