            Okay now hear me out, you might be thinking <q>but Sips you come from the future you must have some sort of telecommunications system to hold of people right?</q> and yes you will be right for making that assumption because we do however have a telecommunications system which was recovered during the salvaging era back home where people were searching for all bits  technology to understand what world we live in, but this level of technology that this kid is explaining to me is crazy, I don't know maybe I'm just too thirsty for knowledge. So basically how the technology works, there are telecommunications cables connected throughout the city and inside the homes of locals and these connect to a central coms tower and people can easily communicate to each other but they can only access the telephone where it is installed so if the phone was at your house you can only make calls from the house, so I had to get a picture of this and document all of this important information also to make things much better they boy even showed me what they used for wireless telecommunications which looks like a very ancient version of our coms receiver which they call the cellphone  and can be used anywhere so I took a picture of the cellphone, good thing the boy did not notice my photographic machine and I also managed to get a picture of the telephone without the manager noticing documenting them in the museum, way to go Sips!. It was a great end to the day gathering 3 bits of information about the technology in this Time.
