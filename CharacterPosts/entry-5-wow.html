        <h1>WOW!</h1>

        <br>

        <p>Date: 1 January 2000</p>

            Ok so now here we are, I am intrigued about the device the manager was using butI can't simply ask him to tell me what the device is without blowing my cover, I think it is stime to show my worth. During our training sessions back home we had to show exceptional levels of awareness and <q>situational adaptation</q>, basically it means how well someone can adapt to a situation to their advantage, so because of the AI technology salvaged through ruins the organization was able to create simulations for us to exercise our skills and I was exceptional at them which is one of the contributing factors for being picked for this mission. Now I could use this opportunity to ask the boy for some information while he is viewing the computer, children are usually very ignorant about a lot of things so he is the best person to ask as he will not get too suspicious and ask a lot of questions. The mother takes her son to the computer booth and leaves to have a look at the other items in the store. I approach the boy with the utmost confidence, I first start talking to him about the computer and getting his thoughts on it, he likes it!. Now the boy is very sharp and has a good understanding for technology which shooked me for a boy that was 12 years old as he mentioned, so I begin to ask him about the strange device  and he tells that the device is what they call the telephone, a device used to communicate to people from all over the world, my first reaction was <q>WOW</q>.
