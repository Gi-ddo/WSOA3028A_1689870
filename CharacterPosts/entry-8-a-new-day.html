        <h1>A new day</h1>

        <p>
            Date: 8 January 2000

             So after a week of being in this time and learning how people live it has become clear to me that we still have a long way to go before we finish our mission. The issues with time travel and discovery is that you can't stay in one place time for a very long time because of two reasons really: 1. We do not want to alter the course of time, by this I mean we do not want to say and alter too many events in time because this can change the overall timeline for the future, we could be going back to a future where the incident didn't happen or a future much worse than the one we are already experiencing. 2. We do not want to age at this time, we are still human after all we grow old. So during the last week, we were planning on how we were going to manage this adventure in a way that does not violate our two rules, so this is what we came up with:
             Since we were able to fix our pod during the past week we were able to set our pod to send us a couple of years into future or the past(This tech is yet to be improved) so we decided to take monthly trips to different points in our history and discovery as much as possible for the whole year and return home with new information. The reason why we chose monthly trips was that we thought that it was a suitable amount of time to not cause a lot of chaos in a specific time and learn as much as possible. So with our plan in motion, we were ready to set out on our newly updated mission.
