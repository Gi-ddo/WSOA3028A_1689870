            While we're still at the internet cafe admiring version 1.0 of the computer and looking at all of the different functionality offers,
            I stop and admire my surroundings and appreciate how lucky I am to be in this time of old, thinking to myself how deep in trouble the human race will be in a few decades. My attention is turned to another device being used by the manager of the internet cafe, now this is where it gets interesting. It appears to me that the manager is talking into the device and holding it into his ear as though he is trying to relay a message to someone, I am intrigued, I want to know what that device is but I can't simply just watch up and ask him what the is device it will give off that I do not know much about the devices they use in this time because it seemed to me that everyone in this time would know what the device is called so I had to improvise. A few seconds later a mother and what appears to be her son arrive at the cafe, the son looks very excited and this is given off by how he is begging his mother to take him to the computer, I figured that this might be a great opportunity to get to know a few more things about this time before we move on.
