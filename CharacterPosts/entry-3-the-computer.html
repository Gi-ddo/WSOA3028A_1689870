    <h2>The computer</h2>

    <p>
        As we enter this internet cafe, we see a plethora of people using these strange devices it seemed as though they were the newest thing at this time and we wanted to know all about them. We ask the people handling the cafe what was all the excitement about. They said that it's the newest version of the computer and it's here in Africa. We were star struck, the computer was huge, it had a very big screen, a large case for its processor and a 
        very thick keyboard, we wondered how people survived with these machines, Tumi took a sneak picture of the machine with our photographic machine without anymore noticing and documented on our "Museum" journal.
