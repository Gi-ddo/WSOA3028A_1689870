         <h1>The arcade machine</h1>

        <p>
            So on our final week in the year 2000 we thought that it would be cool to get check out the local areas where people go for 
            entertainment. After hours of searching we found this place, it weas populated by childreen and teens, they were playing all sorts 
            of fun activities, from what seemed to be a miniture horse that people ride of for a fee. They also had a remote controlled car and what really stood out to
            me what the big machine all of the kids were lining up tp play. The kids called an arcade machine. It had a huge cataloge of games that everyone was dying to play.
            including me. The machine required the player to insert a coin to playu, so I played the game space in spaceInvaders. The game was great, it
            had solid exeperience. We took pictures of the machine. After that session I decided that I was going to make an attampt to recreate the game as we cannot get our hands
            on one of the machines.
