    <h2>What to do?</h2>
    <p>
        So here we are in quite a foreign world, everything looks so new the buildings are still intact and the cities are filled with going about with their business. This feels very weird
        the peaciful nature of this land is what I am not used to. As we explore the year 2000 version of Joburg, we start searching for every bit of technological devices we could find.
        As we enter the city with the big buildings, it was very overwhelming because we stood out with our very futuristic yet old outfits because in our world we don't have much going for us
        with regards to fashion, it was like we were the ones traveling to the future. We stumbled upon this very busy building in  what they call downtown joburg, building was called an internet 
        cafe, there were alot of people inside using an unknown technological piece, we were intrigued we went in.
