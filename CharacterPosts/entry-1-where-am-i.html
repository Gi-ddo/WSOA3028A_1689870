 <h2>Where am I?</h2>
  <p>
     The time to travel time has come, Sips has prepared to for this moment since he first joined the organization and it's his chance to prove his worth.
     The time travellers are dispatched in groups of 3, this is to ensure that if anything goes wrong atleast one person can return home safely and report back.
     I has been assigned with two of my working collegues that I have  been acquianted with during my time in the organization , They are named Mark and Tumi, 
     both share the same drive as I to uncover the mysterious left in the past. We were set and ready on  our assigned time pod. The journey
     was quick and sudden, it all happened in a matter of seconds, we had arrived.Upon landing we had circuiting issues and were not able to tell where 
     we were, this presented a few problems as we had to ask people without hinting away at the fact that we were not from this time.  Luckily for the us
     we had arrived at a rather eventful time in the world. As we stepped out of the pod, we had landed at a remote site not too  from the city, as we were approaching 
     city there were distant posters visible from  quite a distant saying the words "Welcome to the new Mellenium, 21st century here we come" from then we knew that we were in 
     the year 2000 in South Africa.
