 <h2>Where am I?</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
    The time to travel time has come, Sips has prepared for this moment since he first joined the organization and it's his chance to prove his worth.
     The time travelers are dispatched in groups of 3, this is to ensure that if anything goes wrong at least one person can return home safely and report back.
     I have been assigned with two of the working colleagues that I have been acquainted with during my time in the organization, They are named Mark and Tumi, 
     both share the same drive as I to uncover the mysterious left in the past. We were set and ready on our assigned time pod. The journey was quick and sudden, it all happened in a matter of seconds, we had arrived. Upon landing we had circuiting issues and were not able to tell where we were, this presented a few problems as we had to ask people without hinting away at the fact that we were not from this time.  Luckily for us, we had arrived at a rather eventful time in the world. As we stepped out of the pod, we had landed at a remote site not too from the city, as we were approaching city there were distant posters visible from quite a distant saying the words "Welcome to the new Millennium, 21st century here we come" from then we knew that we were in the year 2000 in South Africa.
