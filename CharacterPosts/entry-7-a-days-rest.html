                    As the day draws to a close it was time for us to call it day and rest, our pods were designed for us to travel for a very long time thus they had bunkers installed for us to use until we fit in well enough to join the public. So we left the internet cafe and made our way back to the pod, which by the way was well hidden in the remote site where we landed.
                    As we were walking past the busy streets oh JHB( yes they were still busy even in the evening) I just couldn't stop admiring how beautiful the city looked especially as it was  dark, from the lights and how they connect to form these beautiful pathways towards streets and the flickering lights of the buildings I couldn't help myself, I had to take a picture of this beautiful sensation. As we got back to the pod I showed the gang what I had discovered their reactions was simply hysterical. Now that we had a taste of the city it was time to play our next plan of action.
