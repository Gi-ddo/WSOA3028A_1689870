        <p> A browser is software application used to retrieve, display and store content from the world wide web. These types of
            contents include web pages, images, videos and music etc. All the digital medium we have access to is mostly received
            through a browser, these browsers are accessed through our phones and computers. The most widely known browsers are:
            Chrome, Firefox, Internet explorer, Safari and Opera.
        </p>

            Browers work in hierarchical manner to process all the information we request and feed it back to us on our computers
            and phones.
            The structure is as follows:

                    use today.
