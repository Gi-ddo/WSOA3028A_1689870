        <h1>Character Description</h1>
        <p>
            Sipho "Sips", born and raised in the late 21st century in a dystopian South African. He is
            average height(1,5m), has a lean body type, brown eyes and short black hair. People often
            recognize him by his scar on his left cheek that he got earlier on in his mischievous
            endeavours as a child.
        </P>

        <p>
            Sips is in his late teens and he is still trying to find purpose in life. The
            world is in disarray and needs to be rebuilt. Information about the past has been lost
            through historic events thus many people with various skills that can very help in
            rebuilding the world are in dire need.
        </p>

        Sips has a passion for adventure and searching for the unknown, using
        his intellectual skills and knowledge. He spent most of his life trying to learn about the past
        and how to help improve the future through technology and science rather than physical work
        in the form of rebuilding cities and facilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            His drive for adventure has earned him a great
            deal of Street smarts and connections. After sometime Sips discovered that there is an organization
            that came about with the purpose of finding our lost history through time travel. Sips decided
            to make it his life mission to join the organization and go back in time to find and restore our
            technology and history.
