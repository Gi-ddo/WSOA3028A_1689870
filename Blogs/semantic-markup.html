            What is Semantic Markup? Why is it necessary?
        </h1
    
        <p>
            According to modern day dictionaries semantic refers to the correct use and interpretation of a word or
            sentence. Using that definition, we can then define semantic markup by saying it is the correct use of a markup
            language like html to convey the correct use of html tags to give meaning to the type of content presented
            within the tags.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Semantic Markup is necessary because it helps browsers correctly identify the type of information the developers present
            in their websites. It is also useful because it is both human and machine readable. If an automated bot were to check
            information presented in a website that used semantic markup the bot will be able to tell what each piece of information
            represents, this also applies to humans as well, the use of semantic markup makes it easier for other developers to
            understand what is being presented.
        </p>

            To give more context, the use of the div and spam tags have no semantic meaning to the website, this makes it difficult
            for bots and humans to understand what different types of content represent. Therefore, the correct use of takes like
            section , article and nav make it easier to distinguish what each type of information represents. For example, the
            section tag represent a standalone section of content on the website and the nav tag represents a navigation of links in
            a section of a page. The div and span tags do not provide this type of information and thus makes them asemantic tag for
            web development.
