Information about the past has been lost through historic events thus many people with various skills that can very helpful in rebuilding the world are in dire need.
            Sips has a passion for adventure and searching for the unknown , using his intellectual skills and knowledge. He spent most of his life trying to learn about the past and how to help improve the future through technology and science rather than physical work in the form of rebuilding cities and facilities.
            His drive for adventure has earned him plenty of Street smarts and connections. After sometime Sips discovered that there is an organization that came about with the purpose of finding our lost history through time travel. Sips decided to make it his life mission to join the organization and go back in time to find and restore our technology and history.
